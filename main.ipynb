The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies. \n",

Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.\n",
      "Within Parity, the Ecosystem and Business Development team is charged with the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem by attracting teams to build in the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem. As an important member of the Growth team, you will contribute to our Go-To-Market Strategy which targets various segments of the Web3 ecosystem and you will enact this strategy via strategic outbound campaigns, nurturing inbound leads, and managing complex engagements. \n",

      "Experience building systems that software developers and end-users love.\n",
      "A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or closely related field.  The unique challenges at DFINITY have attracted many engineers with advanced degrees, however your practical experience is more important to us than your educational background.\n",

We bring transparency and smarter qualitative and quantitative analytics to the industry by combining a global research database with a comprehensive suite of data visualization and asset discovery tools. We help drive smarter participation in crypto from individuals and institutions alike.\n",
      " \n",
      "The name “Messari” came from the Franciscan monks who declared \"clean books\" a moral imperative during the renaissance and pushed merchants to use proper accounting methods.  This led to the flourishing of investment via \"trust but verify\" methods and industry growth throughout Europe. That's what we aim to do. Provide participants, investors, builders, platforms, and everyone else with reliable information to better participate in the crypto ecosystem.\n",
      " \n",

As Messari grows, data engineering, machine learning,  and particularly NLP will become critical.\n",

      "Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests often conflict with our own. Despite that conflict, we still use their software either because many of the benefits seem to outweigh any perceived risk, we feel there is no choice, or there is no better alternative. As a result, we end up granting such companies access to our personal data which, in turn, gives them far-reaching control over our digital lives and in that, unprecedented influence over a multitude of globally impactful initiatives and innovations.\n",
      "Parity Technologies is a team of the world’s premiere blockchain developers building industry-leading technologies that enable developers to create the next wave of better products and services that respect the freedom and data of individuals. You’ll join at a critical moment when the future of the decentralized web is being shaped, and perform an influential role in making a more equitable society for our future. \n",
      "We primarily steward the Substrate ecosystem which includes Polkadot and Kusama, both of which are next-generation, sharded, multichain networks. Our flagship product, Substrate, is an open-source modular and extensible blockchain-building framework that allows rapid innovation and fast deployment of custom built blockchains. Substrate provides the core building blocks of blockchains built for deployment to Polkadot and Kusama. Our key programming language is Rust, and all of our work is open source.\n",

      "Job description: \n",
      "The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain — incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world-renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a ‘world computer’ powerful enough to host Web3 dApps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.\n",
      "DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.\n",
      "Can you tune TCP, reason about latencies across continents, evaluate alternate protocols? Have you worked on large distributed systems? The DFINITY protocol involves deploying efficient, sybil-resistent Peer-to-Peer networks at global scale.  We are seeking engineers with experience working on world-scale networking challenges to join our team.\n",
      "You will have the chance to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Help build a novel sybil-resistant world-scale P2P network.\n",
      "Reason about and solve problems related to all known network-level attack types.\n",
      "Evaluate novel alternate protocols and routing mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      " We know and respect that great software engineers come from a great variety of backgrounds.  Where you come from is of interest to us, but what we care most about is what you can do.  \n",
      " Some of the things that may be helpful preparation for a role at DFINITY include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience shipping significant software systems as part of a medium to large organization. \n",
      "A deep understanding of at least one systems software language like C, C++, or Rust.  Our P2P network will initially be built in Rust (we will teach you)\n",
      "Experience deploying and operating systems that run 24x7x365 and building the monitoring, alarming, and tooling required to keep them healthy.  \n",
      "A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field.  The unique challenges at DFINITY have attracted many engineers with advanced degrees, however your practical experience is more important to us than your educational background.\n",
      "\n",
      " What kind of engineers are we looking for? \n",
      "\n",
      "First, we seek a passion for building quality production systems software and tools. Research is an important component of what we do, however our first passion is for changing the world by shipping software. \n",
      "Second, we are looking for team players who enjoy working alongside other brilliant people to come up with the best solutions together.  \n",
      "Finally, curiosity and open mindedness are critical.  No one has built one of these before! The problems are challenging, and we need innovators to help solve them.\n",

Parity was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum, the primary engineer behind the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), inventor of the Solidity programming language, and primary author of the Ethereum Yellowpaper.\n",
      "Based in Berlin, London, and Lisbon with over 340 employees worldwide, Parity has built clients for Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Zcash and has pioneered a completely new, next-generation blockchain protocol with Polkadot and the framework it’s built with, Substrate. Parity builds the open-source technologies needed to power an unstoppable, decentralized web—known as Web3—and helps developers and organizations implement and build upon the Web3 tech stack.\n",
      "About the position:\n",
      "Parity has a lot of products: blockchain clients written in Rust, mobile apps written in platform-native languages, browser-based tools and extensions written in JavaScript. We also maintain some crypto and networking libraries (mostly in Rust) and a blockchain framework used by several hundreds of third-party teams. All of this code needs to be consistently secured — and as a head of AppSec, it would be your job.\n",
      "What you will do:\n",

      "be that important link helping security researchers (be that independent auditors, bug bounty hunters or even yourself) and engineers in charge of the code understand each other; \n",
      "help teams learn state of the art security practices and embed them into day-to-day work;\n",

      "have understanding of modern blockchain tech landscape and the new classes of threats it experiences;\n",
      "have experience in threat modelling, red/blue teaming, working with best in class independent security teams and turning their findings into actual deployed fixes in our codebase;\n",
      "be able to help with hiring, lead the resulting team and set up security practices all around the company;\n",
      "be a self-starter: most of the time there would be little guidance on which areas to work on first and what to improve there. You’re expected to determine that yourself, keeping company-wide goals in mind, and drive those initiatives to completion.\n",

      "Your future company: Parity\n",
      "Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests and incentives often conflict with our own. If we want the benefits of using their proprietary apps, we’re forced to agree to terms that grant these companies far-reaching control over our digital lives.\n",
      "Open-source and decentralised technologies like blockchain can build systems that prioritise individual sovereignty over centralised control, without the need to trust any third parties.\n",
      "Parity Technologies is a team of the world’s premiere blockchain developers building industry-leading technologies that enable developers to create this next wave of better products and services. Our technologies include Substrate, a flexible framework for building blockchains, and Polkadot, a protocol for connecting and securing blockchains. Our key programming language is Rust, and all of our work is open source.\n",
      "Your future team: Org Strategy\n",
      "Org Strategy is a small team that works closely with many departments, such as Engineering, People, Recruiting, and Ops. Our vision is to attract and retain the smartest people in the world to build the future of the decentralised web.

      "How you’ll make an impact\n",
      "\n",
      "As the face of the onboarding experience, you’ll build relationships with all new hires and make sure every new joiner is set up for success during their first months at Parity. You’ll be working closely with the People team who are your co-pilots in the onboarding journey.\n",
      "You’re the go-to person for questions and regularly organise in-person and virtual initiatives that help new hires get familiar with the Parity culture and have a great experience.\n",
      "You’re in charge of creating/updating all content provided to new joiners during their onboarding experience.\n",
      "You’ll regularly conduct new hire interviews to gather insights that can be used to optimise processes and help hiring managers lead better. As we’re growing quickly, interviews will be a big part of your work.\n",
      "Working closely with all stakeholders, you’ll facilitate meetings, keep everyone informed and aligned, and measure progress and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we’d like to see in you\n",
      "\n",
      "5+ years of experience in a (HR/People/Community) role where onboarding was your main task. Bonus if this was a remote, global workplace.\n",
      "Highly organised: You easily keep track of all new hires, their current phase in the onboarding journey, and what they need.\n",
      "Doer mentality: You’re proactive, execute on tasks on time and work transparently and autonomously.\n",
      "Curious with a learner/builder mindset.\n",

We are backed by top-tier investors, have offices in SF and NY, and are just getting started.\n",
      "As an engineer at CoinList you’ll find that your days are filled with all sorts of fascinating challenges -- from developing smart contracts, to architecting a high performance exchange, to simplifying the complex to help bring crypto to a mainstream audience. Our work is difficult and ambitious, which is what makes it fun.\n",
      "If you are an entrepreneurial person with exceptional engineering talent, we’d love to hear from you.\n",
      "Who you are:\n",
      "\n",
      "You love to code. You build stuff for fun on nights and weekends. You contribute to open source. You have deep expertise in certain areas (e.g., React) but you consider yourself a generalist and you enjoy learning new platforms.\n",
      "You’re really smart. You were a top student in your computer science program or have been teaching yourself programming from an early age. You like being around people who challenge you.\n",
      "You’re curious. You want to understand how things work. You value interesting things, especially outside your discipline. You like teaching others and constantly learning. You read and question things.\n",
      "You like to ship. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. People know they can count on you to get things done.\n",
      "You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You’ve built apps for fun and worked on side projects before. You’re interested in all aspects of startups - from user testing, to marketing, to raising capital. If you haven’t already started your own company, you think you might like to in the future.\n",
      "You care about the product. You might not be a product expert, but you value good design. You enjoy thinking about why certain products work and discussing new apps. You want to build delightful products that users love and that make people’s lives more meaningful.\n",
      "You have good values. You enjoy hanging out with your teammates, make the workplace more fun for everyone, and care about doing the right thing.\n",
      "You are a 10x thinker, far more excited by huge disruptions than by small improvements. If something is hard, that makes it more fun, and you know that if anyone can figure it out, you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you will do:\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll contribute in all areas. You might choose to go deep in web development or building open source dev tools to automate our operations, but like your teammates you’ll make a habit of working across the stack, frequently picking up new languages and platforms as needed.\n",
      "You’ll ship product. From hack days, to experimental prototypes, to developing a new type of auction model, you’ll constantly be building and shipping product. You’ll write clean, well-documented code, do unit tests, follow best practices, and have the benefit of working in a place where people move fast.\n",
      "You’ll rapidly grow and improve. At CoinList you’ll be working with some of the smartest engineers you’ve ever met, who love to learn and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, and engrossed in deep conversations on a daily basis.\n",
      "You’ll help shape the product. Our whole team cares deeply about the product and has significant input into its development. You’ll beta test new prototypes and talk directly with users, and your ideas will always be heard.\n",
      "You’ll learn about startups. From fundraising, to recruiting, to negotiating an office lease, you’ll learn everything there is to know about growing and running a startup of your own, and we’ll do everything we can to connect you with mentors and advisors to help you with your career for years to come.\n",
      "You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring smart people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s running a critical token sale or leading our work on a new platform, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.\n",
      "You’ll create the future. Crypto is a far bigger deal than most people realize, and at CoinList you will be be at the forefront of it. There are all sorts of technical challenges you’ll be working though and new questions you’ll have to answer, in partnership with founders for the leading crypto projects across the globe. If you’re successful, you’ll build something the world has never before seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an early employee at CoinList you will be a critical part of our core team and have a huge influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and do everything we can to make sure this is the single best work experience of your life. At CoinList, we are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.
