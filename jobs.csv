About Messari.
Messari is the leading provider of crypto market intelligence products that help professionals navigate crypto/Web3 with confidence. We bring transparency and smarter qualitative and quantitative analytics to the industry by combining a global research database with a comprehensive suite of data visualization and asset discovery tools. We help drive smarter participation in crypto from individuals and institutions alike.

The name Messari came from the Franciscan monks who declared ""clean books"" a moral imperative during the renaissance and pushed merchants to use proper accounting methods. This led to the flourishing of investment via ""trust but verify"" methods and industry growth throughout Europe.That's what we aim to do. Provide participants, investors, builders, platforms, and everyone else with reliable information to better participate in the crypto ecosystem.

Our users range from some of the most prominent analysts, investors, and crypto individuals to top organizations including Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage, 0x, Chainanalysis, Ledger, Compound, MakerDAO, and many more.
Your Role
We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to expand the scope and reliability of our API product, data.messari.io. As our business grows, the complexity of our API increases as well. Messari maintains a long list of API endpoints, backed by numerous microservices behind the scenes. We want to provide the most premium experience possible for all our API users, from individual hobbyists to large institutions. 

This is an important role where you will work full-time on our user-facing API service, called Meridian, as it constantly expands in scope. You will write new features and handlers, maintain cleanliness and readability in the related codebase, help with developer-facing documentation, and more. Prior experience maintaining a high-profile public API is highly desirable for this role. 

The right person for this role should be meticulously detail-oriented, enjoy putting things in order, and comfortable with a high degree of ownership over a critical customer-facing system. Our API layer is mostly written in Go, with some Typescript and Java. For most of our new services, we like Go for its simplicity and maintainability. We deploy using Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services. That being said, we're not dogmatic and always believe in using the best tool for the job.
What you'll do:


Design and build a robust API product line, from monitoring, SLA uptime, to pricing strategy
Meticulously build an API testing suite to ensure the quality of the product is enterprise grade
Help maintain our public API documentation and related internal documentation 
Build and maintain tooling related to user authentication, API keys, rate limiting, and more 
Scale up the throughput of our systems by an order of magnitude

Who you are:

 2+ years experience with modern backend technologies including Golang, Postgres, and AWS (Java is helpful too) 
Experience maintaining a mission-critical production API (GraphQL is a plus!) 
Interested in information management, communication, and technical writing 
A desire to work on big complex projects with lots of ownership
A passion for shipping high-quality products 
Empathetic and love to help your teammates grow

Projects you could work on:

API orchestration! Write new endpoints and handlers, add new features to make queries more efficient and convenient, and elevate proper standards for how to design new endpoints over time
API pricing! Build a subscription management system to capture and bill metered usage per customer
User management! Write a new microservice to own and maintain our customer list internally and across our integrations, handle API key generation, authentication, etc. 
Rate limiting and logging! Expand the capabilities of our rate limiting system, help keep better track of our API traffic for observability, and more 

What's it like to work with our engineering team?

A welcoming and open environment with people who love to collaborate on ideas and tackle complex problems
Work with a small team of engineers with large impact across product, research, and business development
Participate in forums like Family Meals and Messari Lab to share ideas or technologies youve been exploring and tinkering with

The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain  incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world-renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a world computer powerful enough to host Web3 dApps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.
DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.

You live and breathe design, aesthetics, intuitive UX

You have knowledge and understanding of various design systems, frontend frameworks, and processes for implementing user-facing software
You know basic front-end: HTML, CSS, JS, but are looking for a place where you can flex your software muscle

Responsibilities:
As a UI/UX lead, you will work towards creating a world-class user experience. You will be shaping up the major user-facing components of the Internet Computer ecosystem in the areas of governance and identity user experience (wallets, authentication systems, DeFi). Your responsibilities include:

Improve UI/UX of the existing functionality and developing UI/UX for new features for system dapps like Internet Identity and NNS Frontend
Conduct usability testing and help identify priorities for usability improvements
Work with the leadership and product teams to shape the product and brand strategy of the system user-facing dapps
Create storyboards, wireframes and screen flows
Work very closely with frontend developers (we use Svelte framework) to ship UX features and improvements
Partner with the Design and Editorial teams to scope and execute an end-to-end digital content strategy and brand identity

230,Messari + Sr. Machine Learning Engineer,Full-time,Remote - US,"
About Messari.
Messari is the leading provider of crypto market intelligence products that help professionals navigate crypto/Web3 with confidence. We bring transparency and smarter qualitative and quantitative analytics to the industry by combining a global research database with a comprehensive suite of data visualization and asset discovery tools. We help drive smarter participation in crypto from individuals and institutions alike.

The name Messari came from the Franciscan monks who declared ""clean books"" a moral imperative during the renaissance and pushed merchants to use proper accounting methods. This led to the flourishing of investment via ""trust but verify"" methods and industry growth throughout Europe.That's what we aim to do. Provide participants, investors, builders, platforms, and everyone else with reliable information to better participate in the crypto ecosystem.

Our users range from some of the most prominent analysts, investors, and crypto individuals to top organizations including Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage, 0x, Chainanalysis, Ledger, Compound, MakerDAO, and many more.
Your Role
Messari is looking for an experienced senior machine learning engineer to drive our growing NLP efforts. This is an exciting opportunity to define and implement the machine learning strategy as we scale to more complex use cases and from millions to billions of documents. As Messari grows, data engineering, machine learning, and particularly NLP will become critical.
From a technical side, we currently use spaCy & Python, but were flexible and pragmatic with technology choices. Most of the other services at Messari are Golang based with some Rust for performance and Java for legacy apps.
What you'll do

Own and manage production NLP projects end-to-end, beginning with our existing NER & classification pipeline and extending to new projects as we expand.
Drive the data collection, quality and annotation processes across the company.
Operationalize, monitor and integrate models across the company for critical external and internal production use cases.
Educate the team and the company on the state of the art as well as present automation and product opportunities given our rich datasets and talented analysts.

Who you are

You have 4+ years experience with production backend software engineering using reasonably modern technologies (like SQL, Git) and languages (like Python, Java, Golang).
You have 3+ years experience building robust production machine learning & NLP applications from beginning to end and youre deeply interested in and cognizant of the evolution, state and future of NLP and deep ML more broadly.
You are pragmatic and product-driven - this is not a research position, but we realize we may need to innovate where it matters to become industry-leading. Whatever works best works, whether it is off-the-shelf, fine-tuned or trained from scratch.
You are ready and willing to own and drive a complex project, from taking into account internal and external stakeholders to defining, refining, planning, executing and maintaining a vision.
You are willing, capable and happy to get deep down into the unglamorous but essential details of operating a complex service (e.g., tuning SQL query performance, handling weird endpoints)

Projects you could work on

NER, classification & linking: Improve and extend our NER & classification models for analyzing crypto content. Replace our rules-driven with an ML-driven entity linking model.
Sentiment: Build robust sentiment analysis models for challenging crypto content across news, social media, forms and other diverse sources.
Event extraction & linking: Extract complete events end-to-end on top of / akin to our NER & classification pipeline and link/cluster them with internal and external databases.

What's it like to work with our engineering team?

A welcoming and open environment with people who love to collaborate on ideas and tackle complex problems
Work with a small team of engineers with large impact across product, research, and business development
Participate in forums like Family Meals and Messari Lab to share ideas or technologies youve been exploring and tinkering with


Salary Ranges for this position (depending upon experience):  #LI-AS1Associate: $135,000 - $155,000Mid: $155,000 - $185,000Senior: $185,000 - $200,000 +

247,Parity + AppSec Engineer (Application Security),Full-time,Remote (Central European Time (CET)),"
About the position (or What you will do)
Parity has a lot of products: blockchain clients written in Rust, mobile apps written in platform-native languages, browser-based tools, and extensions written in JavaScript. We also maintain some crypto and networking libraries (mostly in Rust) and a blockchain framework used by several hundreds of third-party teams. All of this code needs to be consistently secured  and as a head of AppSec, it would be your job.
You would need to:

be that important link helping security researchers (be those independent auditors, bug bounty hunters, or even yourself) and engineers in charge of the code understand each other;
help teams learn state of the art security practices and embed them into day-to-day work;
perform a lot of threat modelling and other pre-audit documentation work to help us get most kick for the (quite significant) buck we spend on those audits;
hone and improve our security-related processes like bug bounty and internal vulnerability response;
and of course, this is not a single-man job, so youd be working with other team members to achieve those challenges.

We expect you to:

know your security tools and approaches: you should be leading our way when setting up SAST, DAST, fuzzing, property-based testing, symbolic execution, network simulation tools and such;
have exposure to cryptography, decentralized networking, hardware key management solutions;
have understanding of modern blockchain tech landscape and the new classes of threats it experiences;
have experience in threat modelling, red/blue teaming, working with best in class independent security teams and turning their findings into actual deployed fixes in our codebase;
be a self-starter: most of the time there would be little guidance on which areas to work on first and what to improve there. Youre expected to determine that yourself, keeping company-wide goals in mind, and drive those initiatives to completion.

And ideally also:

Rust knowledge;
Prior work experience in blockchain/cryptocurrency fields;
located in or willing to relocate to Europe;
A background in open source software development;
Passionate about Web 3.0 and what it represents for the future;
Have an interest in Parity and accompanying technologies such as Substrate.


About Parity
The team at Parity builds core infrastructure to power a better internet. We do this by innovating in and fostering the open source ecosystem surrounding blockchain development, also known as Web 3.0.
Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests often conflict with our own. Despite that conflict, we still use their software either because many of the benefits seem to outweigh any perceived risk, we feel there is no choice, or there is no better alternative. As a result, we end up granting such companies access to our personal data which, in turn, gives them far-reaching control over our digital lives and in that, unprecedented influence over a multitude of globally impactful initiatives and innovations.
Parity Technologies is a team of the worlds premiere blockchain developers building industry-leading technologies that enable developers to create the next wave of better products and services that respect the freedom and data of individuals. Youll join at a critical moment when the future of the decentralized web is being shaped, and perform an influential role in making a more equitable society for our future.
We primarily steward the Substrate ecosystem which includes Polkadot and Kusama, both of which are next-generation, sharded, multichain networks. Our flagship product, Substrate, is an open-source modular and extensible blockchain-building framework that allows rapid innovation and fast deployment of custom built blockchains. Substrate provides the core building blocks of blockchains built for deployment to Polkadot and Kusama. Our key programming language is Rust, and all of our work is open source.

511,DFINITY + Software Engineer - Networking,Full-time,"Zurich, CH","
The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain  incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world-renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a world computer powerful enough to host Web3 dApps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.
DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.
Can you tune TCP, reason about latencies across continents, evaluate alternate protocols? Have you worked on large distributed systems? The DFINITY protocol involves deploying efficient, sybil-resistent Peer-to-Peer networks at global scale. We are seeking engineers with experience working on world-scale networking challenges to join our team.
You will have the chance to:

Help build a novel sybil-resistant world-scale P2P network.
Reason about and solve problems related to all known network-level attack types.
Evaluate novel alternate protocols and routing mechanisms.

We know and respect that great software engineers come from a great variety of backgrounds. Where you come from is of interest to us, but what we care most about is what you can do.
Some of the things that may be helpful preparation for a role at DFINITY include:

Experience shipping significant software systems as part of a medium to large organization.
A deep understanding of at least one systems software language like C, C++, or Rust. Our P2P network will initially be built in Rust (we will teach you)
Experience deploying and operating systems that run 24x7x365 and building the monitoring, alarming, and tooling required to keep them healthy.
A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field. The unique challenges at DFINITY have attracted many engineers with advanced degrees, however your practical experience is more important to us than your educational background.

What kind of engineers are we looking for?

First, we seek a passion for building quality production systems software and tools. Research is an important component of what we do, however our first passion is for changing the world by shipping software.
Second, we are looking for team players who enjoy working alongside other brilliant people to come up with the best solutions together.
Finally, curiosity and open mindedness are critical. No one has built one of these before! The problems are challenging, and we need innovators to help solve them.


All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Engineers will come to you as a trusted source of guidance for the secure development and maintenance of their products. Your insight will be consulted for strategic technical decisions, to guarantee that security is not an afterthought in our technical roadmap.
Being part of the preventative defense for our company, you'll identify and mitigate emerging threats to Parity Technologies environment stemming from vulnerabilities and architectural issues in the earlier stages of our products. Educating engineers on secure development practices will come into play, through a combination of educational software and your guidance.

569,Parity + Javascript Engineer - Tools,Full-time,Remote,"
Javascript Engineer - Tools

Parity Technologies builds core infrastructure for blockchains and the future Web  one that respects the freedom and data of individuals  and helps empower developers to create better services through decentralized technologies.
At the Parity Tools Team we build tooling and libraries for developers and advanced users, both internal and external, such as block explorers, exchanges, and staking-ops teams. Our tools empower users to integrate and harness Substrate blockchains to their fullest. We believe that a well built tool should be a joy to use, precise in scope and feature set, be hackable, discoverable and composable.
As a team, we write roughly equal amounts of JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust and often collaborate with other Parity teams, notably the SDK, ecosystem development and developer relations teams. While the main focus of this role is on the JavaScript side of things, an ability to read Rust is highly beneficial, and there will be plenty of opportunity to get more involved in the Rust side of things as well over time if that interests you.
Examples of the technologies you will be working with:
Substrate: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate
Polkadot-JS API: https://polkadot.js.org/
Substrate-api-sidecar: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar
Your role will include:

Designing and building http APIs to help external teams build their projects.
Supporting the entire project lifecycle (concept, design, build, test, release and support).
Keeping up to date with the blockchain space in general and the Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem in particular. Work with the integration and ecosystem teams to ensure we build what people need.
Collaborating with the core Substrate team to plan and implement new features and improvements.

Your Background:

Experience and enthusiasm for working with a range of different JavaScript APIs and Frameworks. We use TypeScript.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritize, communicate often, and function well in a distributed team.
Some exposure to, and interest in, Rust. Youve probably played with it in your spare time, if not at a previous job.
Ability to learn new technologies and concepts quickly.
Ability to come up with technical solutions and application architecture.
Passionate about bringing the vision of a decentralized web to the world.

Nice-to-haves:

Open Source experience.
Knowledge about blockchain technologies.
Knowledge in other programming languages than JavaScript/TypeScript.
Public speaking/writing.

Benefits:

Globally competitive compensation.
Opportunity to become an expert in latest blockchain technologies.
Working at Parity means focusing on stuff that matters: building cutting-edge technology for a better and more decentralized internet. Our teams enjoy a high degree of freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
Because we value initiative and learning, all employees have a generous personal budget to attend conferences or other learning tools of your own choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries and we will support you with German language courses and relocation where needed (and desired).
We have a remote-friendly company setup.
Bringing the team together is something we value a lot and we have regular company retreats (as the current pandemic safely permits).

Parity Technologies builds core infrastructure for blockchains and Web 3.0 technologies. We strive to write the fastest, lightest, and safest core technology in Blockchain and write lots of open-source code.
Parity works in a very flat hierarchy with lots of autonomy and high levels of personal responsibility, and we try to mimic an open-source workflow in much of what we do. We have an older article on our blog about our development practices that you may want to read.
You will be joining the Common Good Parachains team, which builds parachains that provide core functionality to the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Our users range from other parachain developers using XCM, application developers, and end-users.
This role is open to develop end-to-end tooling and experiences that will make parachains more accessible and easier to use. It will include working in Substrate FRAME, as well as front-end libraries and applications. Our stack consists of Typescript, React, React-Redux, Rust, Docker, Cypress, Netlify, AWS, and GCP.
About you

Actively participate in suggesting and driving new features and projects by identifying and interviewing stakeholders, outlining project requirements, and coordinating with other teams on delivering code.
Able to design and implement APIs from the ground up.
Ensure our XCM tooling is up to date with the latest changes in Substrate and Polkadot.

Adhere to software engineering best practices and apply creativity and engineering rigour to your work.

Technical requirements

Solid foundation in computer science and programming principles.
Well versed with Typescript on the frontend and backend.
Complex state management with React.

Checking and approving all latest designs across multiple products in your department.
Manage issue prioritization, risk analysis and trade off.
Develop strategies and tactics to study blockchain technologies, and create public awareness of the value for our products.
Driving design function forward by developing new ideas and improving design system.
Thrive in a scrappy environment and are comfortable with ambiguity and frequent changes to direction as the company works towards product-market fit and learns to operate at scale.
Proactively identify issues and assign the right owner to resolve the problem.

Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.

Requirements:

BS degree in Computer Science or a similar technical field of study or equivalent practical experience
